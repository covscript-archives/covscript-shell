# Covariant Script Shell for Windows
The purpose of this project is to solve the problem that Covariant Script Interpreter can not handle ctrl-c interrupt very well.  
But in version 3.3.1.7, I solved this problem. So this project is going to be achieved.  
This is a pretty good example of listening the standard output of other process asynchronously using C# programming language.
